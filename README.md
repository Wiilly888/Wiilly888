### Hi,


I'm a fairly new software developer, and minecraft modder.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Enhanced Food mod for minecraft 1.19.4 and physics simulation software.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and C++.

![My github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Wiilly888&count_private=true&show_icons=true&include_all_commits=true&theme=radical)

Maybe I'll reach somewhere in life.
